		<p class="photo">Photo and recipe submitted by Mary Ann Aschenbrenner.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
			<li>1 tsp. cinnamon</li>
			<li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp. baking powder</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp. nutmeg</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>
			<li>1 cup pumpkin puree</li>
			<li>1/3 cup honey</li>
			<li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
			<li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
			<li>2 Tbls. pumpkin seeds, optional</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Whisk wet ingredients until well combined in a large bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir with a large spoon just until evenly incorporated.</p>
		<p>Spoon batter into 9" by 5" buttered loaf pan. Smooth the top of the batter and tap the pan on the counter to settle the batter. If desired, sprinkle the top with pumpkin seeds.</p>
		<p>Bake at 350 degrees for 60 minutes, checking for doneness after 45 minutes. To prevent bread from getting too brown, cover with aluminum foil toward the end of baking time. When a skewer inserted comes out clean, remove from oven and cool 15 minutes before transfering to bread rack. Cool completely before slicing.</p>

	<h3>Honeyed Fig and Goat Cheese Tart</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Unbleached flour for dusting</li>
		<li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
		<li>4 oz. goat cheese, softened</li>
		<li>1/4 cup honey (preferably dark)</li>
		<li>8 ripe, fresh figs, stemmed and quartered lengthwise</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp. finely chopped fresh rosemary</li>

	<img src="assets/honeyedfiggoatcheesetart400by296.jpg" height="296" width="400" class="imagepage" alt="Honeyed Fig and Goat Cheese Tart" align="right"/>
	<p>Lightly dust a sheet of parchment with flour. Unfold the pastry, place on top of the parchment and lightly dust with flour. Roll out the pastry to a 10" square. Prick all over with a fork at 1/2" intervals. Press a 3/4" border on all sides and fold over to make a double-thick rim. Transfer the pastry on the parchment to a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the center is golden-brown and puffed, about 8 minutes.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, combine the goat cheese and 2 Tbs. of the honey in a medium bowl. Spread the cheese mixture inside the border of the puff pastry. Arrange the figs on the cheese. Sprinkle with the rosemary and 1/8 tsp. salt. Bake until the rim of the pastry is golden-brown, about 7 minutes.</p>
	<p>Drizzle the remaining 2 Tbs. honey and cool for about 15 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
